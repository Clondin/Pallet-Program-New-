## Working style

- Act without asking. The user trusts the agent to run routine Bash commands, edit files, install dependencies, restart the dev server, run lint/builds, and create commits without confirmation prompts. Reverse mistakes after the fact rather than slowing the loop with permission asks.
- Only pause to confirm when there's a genuine security or destructive concern: unfamiliar third-party scripts, secrets/credentials, sending data externally, force-pushing or destructive shared-infra ops.
- Skip the "Want me to…" question — just do it and tell the user what changed.
